most improbable in itself, but also quite at variance with his rapidity
in printing the Now Testament (Ep. 384 1111111.) 11 may fairly be
concluded therefore, that Erasmus’ prefaos ιο F is to be dated 15117
1 1111111111 which is supported by the fact that it is printed on the
first and final sheet, α, with only two other letters, which are dated
13 Aug. and 14 Oct. 1521.

External evidence 1111 11 1111111111 to corroborate this result. In
July 1511 Erasmus writes to Mosellanus that he 11 preparing 1 revi-
sion of 111111111911ι and on 3ο Nov. he tells Barland that the work
111111.ι Further, in 1 letter of (1111.) 1511, Froben³ announoes
to Bonifaoe Amerbach 11 Avignon thet Erasmus has sent ‘Epistolsre
suum ’. Under these circumstances it is evident that Barland’s
volume is prior ιο Pin time.

That Barland’s collection was taken in the main from E 11 shown
by the various readings Of the 115 lettere which it repn'nts
from E, just half (58) have no variants in 1³3 but of the remain-
ing 57, 41 invariably follow E where it differs from E. Two
letters, Epp. 179 and 811, appear in both D and E, and are in
consequence twice reprinted in F. In each case Barland's text
follows 11111 nine timos, 11 1311111111ἰ 11111 the single exceptione
being, in Ep. 179. 13 nasim (10. 11) 111 musra, in Ep. 811. 6 sous

There are, however, two mora categories, 4 letters in which
Barland's text follows sometimes E end sometimes E, and 11
letters in which it follows F against 11 ln Ep. 56 (10. 11 10.) Bar·

From the deoided character of some of the changes in this last
cotegory it is clear that their agreement with F 11111 fortuitous:
and this fact coupled with the inclusion in Barland’s volume 11111
new letters which were subsequently printed in F, indicates that
Erasmus must have sanctioned the undertaking. It may also bs
inferred that he did not begin to interest himself in the book until
it was nearing completion. The new letters are all at the end, Nos
