1 March, when the Apology for the De hade matrimonii was completed. But hc
perhaps went shortly afterwards ιο hiechlin 3 for the word retulerim (Ι. 3) suggests
a return after being sent back to Louvain to negotiata with Oroy. He probably
did not stay at nechlin long after οι hiarch; for by 28 March hc had finished
the Apology against Latomus (Ep. 934. 3 n.), which was a work of two or three
days (Epp. 948. 42, 952.19,ac), and was presumably written at Louvain. A fevv
days later he went off hurriedly ιο Antweip; see Ep. 934. 8 n.

John Iouis Vives (6 March 1492-6hiay ¹540) wasayoung Spaniard who was
just beginning ιο malie a reputation. After education in valencia, his native
town, he came to France c. 1509-10, probably ιο Paris, where for some years he
studied in the Univereity; aleo visiting Bruges c. 1512. His first publiahed
work is an edition cf Hyginus, Paris, J. lambert, aa, with a letter dated
31 March 1514, stating that he was aboutto lecture on it 3 and a short biographi-
cal notice of hie teacher, John Dullardus of Ghent (†10 Sept. 1513), printed in an
edition of Dullardua’ commentary on Aristotle'e tleihccra, Paris, Τ. Keea, 30 May
ι 514· '1¹0 thia period also belongs his christi Iesu Triumphus, dedicated from Paris,
April 1514, ιο Bernard de Besa, who in Jan. 1517 beccum Bp. of Elna (GC. vi.
1066). Vives returned to the Netherlands, probably to Brugcs; and in 1516-7
made the acquaintance of Erasmus at Brueeels (Apol. mmrcepoadet, f⁰. ιι.8 ; J ortin
ii. 497). Later he went ιο England in search of employment (Ep. 545. 15), hut
without succees; and in 1518 he appears as tuter to William Orcy (p. 68) at
Louuain, aud on terme of intimacy with Erasmus (Apol. pec recpohdei, ff. B, θ’ v⁰. :
Jortin il. 500, 507). In (1519) hiericus printed for him a volume of optarem
caric, containing the christi triumphus und many slight compositione addreesed
ιο croy and other patrone (cf. p. 93). 0n 3 March 1520 he received licence to
teach privately in the University (de J ongh, p. ao*). After Groy’e death Vives
remained at Louvain, and, ae a part cf the collected edition of Augustine’s wcrlrs
projected by Erasmus (cf. Ep. 844. 255 m), completed the De ciuitate Dei, Baele,
Froben, Sept. 1522, with a dedication ιο Henry vm. Equipped with this he
visited England in the autumn, again without the success he wished 3 though
Henry acknowledged the dedication with a letter, 24 Jan. 1523.

On the death oi Ant Nebriseensis (Ep. 487. 14n.)an invitation came ιο Vives
ιο till his chair at the Universityof Alcala3 sent through John Vergara, 6 Sept.
1522, from Valladolid (Revue Hispanique vlii, 1901, pp. 247, 2⁶0). In hiay 1523
therefore he determined to revisit Spain; but, taking England cn hie way, hc
attracted the notice of Wolsey, who sent him to teach at Oxferd. He was
lodged in che’s college of Corpus Christi, and was incorporated in the Univer-
sity, ιο Oct. 1523. In April 152⁴ he returned ιο Bruges and married, 26 May;
but in the winter of 1524-5 he was again lecturing at Oxford. Till 1528 he was
, at intervals in England, mostlyat the Court, where he taught the Princeee
Mary3 but for supporting the Queen about the Divcrcc hc fell into disfavour,
and was even for a time under restraint Being driven from England he settled
at Bruges, and there most of hie remaining years were spent ; one of hia visitors,
in 1529, being Ignatius Loyola. It was his mest fruitful literary period ; and
in it he produced a number ef worlrs on educational, political, social and
religione questions, which have not received from pesterity their due of recogni-
tion. Vives ie eminent among the humanista ior the importance that heattached
ιο Αιίιιοιιο7 and, lilrc Erasmus, he frequently raised his voice on behalf of
inter-national peace.

Of his letters 18 to Erasmus and two others were first printed, presumably
from the originale, in vol. ii of the collected edition of hie werke, Baele, Nic.
Episcopius, Aug. 15553 and 39 to various friends appeared in 1556, Antwerp,
G. Simon, probably from the rough drafte (Vi. Ε). There are two original
letters to him of <1524 t) and (1533) in the 'l'own Library at Breelau (Cod. Rehd.
243, tf. 148, 138) : see aleo Al. B. 56 ; Goldaet, cmtmpmruiut, 1610, nos. §¹2²3
and licoat Hispanique viii, 1901, pp. 261, 267. Gourmont's edition of Barland'e
mumanae (p. 63) contains a letter of Vives ιο Barland written from Louvain
(ιθ. g⁶); but it dces not seem possible to assign a date.
