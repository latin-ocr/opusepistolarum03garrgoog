in America to Professor J. 1. Gerig of Columbia University

and in this country to Mr. Loveday of Williamscote, Dr. See·

Ι bohm (t), and Professor W. H. Woodwsrd.

The three whom we mourn as dead need no memorial herc;
their names are known far and wide. M. Vander Haeghen as
a librarian and bibliographer‚ Dr. Seebohm se a historian and
owner of books gave prompt help and encouragement to this
work at its first beginning. nearly twenty years ago. Idelight
to count them as masters and to remcmbsr how much I have
owed to them at every stege. Of him whom his countrymen
sfl'ectionstely call ‘Don Marcelino’ Ι cannot even suy ‘Vidi
tantum' ; but the fragrancc of the welcome extended by his
letters, written in illness, will not fade. Ι should like to be
ableto render to this trio of famous scholare the tribute they
would most have valued, of handing on to those that come
ulter the spirit of high endeavour and ample generosity that
characterized all their work.

With this volume we are practically finished with the two
Deventer manuscripts. Ten years have elapsed, almost to the
day, since they first entered the Bodleian: and they are now on
the point of returning to their northern Athenaeum. All scholare
know how great is the advantage of having originale at hand,
when printing: but only we who have turned to these mauu·
scripts agsin and again csn be conscious of the numerous
occasions on which their presence here has made it possible
to advauce neerer to the standards of accurate reproduction
which such work as this requires. Our most grateful thanks
are due to Dr. van Slee and the Curators of the Deventer
Library for the far-sighted patience with which they heve

acquiesced in this long delay. The assistance they have
rendered us is incomparsble. ·
