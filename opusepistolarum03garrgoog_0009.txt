PREFAOE

As this work pmeds I heve en incrming sense of whet it
owes to others Erasmus was s great treveller ; end his letters,
loo, heve wendered into msny lende-not elweys those to which
ffiey were sddressed. It is s continual plessure to recell not
merely the reedy weleome recorded to us in the numerous
libreries snd erchives it hes been necessary to visit, but also
the sympathetic interest which hss led these welcoming friends
lo remember our studies, end to report, end even to make,
discoveries likely to be of velue.

'l'he most important of these hss been contributed by Professor
Roersch of Ghent3 who found a clue which enehled him to trees
Die de Rem collection of Eresmns’ letters to Schetus end Vender
Noot in the possession of Μ. louis Neve of Louvsin. Though
engaged himself in widely different pursuits‚ M. Neve et onos
recognired the importunes of the discovery, end with the utmost
generosity allowed Professor Roersch to plsee them in our hands
st Ghent in June 1910, to be copied Since then, with the
instinct of e true scholsr, he hss mede it easy for them to psss
in two divisione into the British Museum end the Bodleian,
uther then submit them to be scettered hy the chsnoes of the
multet-place.

For other discoveries, less importent, perhaps, hut scarcely
less ecceptsble, for the loen of books, for advice given, end for
resesrches cheerfully undertaken our thenks ere due:
