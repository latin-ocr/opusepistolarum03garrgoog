that he had reeeived them lrom tha library ol Matthias Bernegger‚ the eelebrated

Alter the last letter he printe (p. 877) a eolophon: ‘Praecedentea epistolas

'Phe correspondenoe of Bernegger printed by Dr. Reifferseheid (Briese G. a. Liss-
marm, Μ· Berressa und am frene 1⁸⁸9, 2⁶⁵. 2⁶⁸, 293³ end rp- 831. ⁸44.
peti-9) shows that tha young Prussian aoholar, Robert Robertbinus (ι6οο-ι648ς
aee ΑΗΒ), was staying with him in his house at strasburg in the winter oi
1⁶²⁸·93 and thus it is clear that Bernegger was the author oi the eolo hon
quoted, and that it was to him thet J ohn Papp (perhaps a aon ol the J ehn app,
1549-1610, who was the leader ol the Lutherans at Straaburgi lent the MSS.

'l'he history ol the Rehdiger HS. may thus be traeed down to the present day.
GleulyGerbell (†15⁶o)hsd required it from Erasmus or his heire. In Marah
1⁶09 it was in the hands ol Gerbell's granddaughter at strasburg: by 1645 one ol
the Rehdlgere had purchased it and plaeed it in the 'l'own Library at ameno,
where it still is; the agent in the transaction being perhaps Boberthinus‚ who
probably made the Rahdigers’ aoquaintanee in 1622 (Reifferscheid, ep. cit. 97. m.

'l'he relation or Ioelere'a appendix to Peoht’s book remains to be eonside
In quantity they am identieal. Eaeh has 43 letters from the Rehdiger MS. (one
oi leolere'a is in the body oi the work, 1093) and a (LB. App. 325, 375) from
some other souree. In both many oi the lettera are abridged‚ to exaetlg the
same extent. Leolere’s text, too, spart from inevitable depravatione an one
oonjeotural amplification of a heading, appears ιο agree with Psebt'a 'l'he
asteriak whieh eadds to thess letters merely denotas that they had not been
included in earlier editione ol Erasmua' letters. The inierenoe seems thers-
iore ιο be plain that Iaeclere derived them, net from the originale, but from
{matroon and further that the abridgment of the lettere waa done by

inus.

Itis notioeable that seme ol Gerball's papers were aeesssible to the Dnrlaoh
airola at about the sams time ς el. J. Η. Maius’ Vita Βιιιοιιιιιι· printed there
in 1⁶87, p. 253 (quoted in ΗΕ. οι).
