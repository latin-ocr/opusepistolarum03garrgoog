634 APPENDIX XIII

Indeed miewritings in the letters are not uncommon, many ot them
being very rapidly written3 so that itis not surprising to find the
printed version sometimes at fault ‚

In the two cases (ff. 184, 217)where we have the opportumty ot
comparing the rough dratts with the fair copies actually sent, rtrs
notioeable that the seoretsry was not scrupulously accurate in his
copying, as we have seen already with Ep. 3²⁶ ; writing tor instance
cam tor tum, greum for eum, besides ·ae tor ·e and making ocossronal
differenees of punctuation and order.

The manuscript volume presente us with ample material for an
examination ol Erasmus’ orthography. It appears that he uses the
form ·e for more commonly than -ae; which rarely occurs except
as e. Inafew oaeestff. 213, 214, ²19 w.) in revising Erasmus adds
aeedilla to an e; but this is quite exceptional. 'Phe form sedebo·
which with its kindred words is regularly printed by the Froben
prese, has hardly any authority tn this manscript, editio berny
Erasmus’ almost invariable usage; though oco occurs thrioe, ¹on
ff. 160-1, and an improving hand, not Erasmus, has added a oedrlli
once, on f. ²09· Again litterae-one ot the words about which it rs
difficult to collect evidence, because in manuscript it is so frequently
eontraoted-is almost always found instead of literae. Pry occurs
only rarely, as also pre, the contracted form being usually adopted.
Sometimes it is quite impossible to determine certainly what
Erasmus wrote. The vowels are often so alike that the only gcrds
isin the sense, and where this fsils there isno arbIter. 'I'he same
word, for example, might not inhequently be read either possam,
possim or possem ηοῐᾶηι οι· nolui; and the terminatione ·is and -rus
are often indistinguishable.
