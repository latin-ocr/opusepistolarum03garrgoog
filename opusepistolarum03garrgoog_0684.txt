182 APPENDIX XIII

their historical value3 lor in that ease we might fairly expect 19 lind
them carehrlly sorted out and the letters especially placed in chreno
logical order. It seems more as though it were a congeries brought
together almost haphazard by some one desirous of gathering aud yet
hardly hesding what he gathered: asfor instance humbert Comannne,
‚ Erasmus’ last secretary, might have laid his hands hastily on sncb
papers as he could find alter his masters death. For this suggestion
there is some confirmation in the fact that, notwithstanding what “
has been said, there is a certain degree cf arrangement about the
papers In the Eccleicrcs and other compositione the displacement

“ which occurs is not of single sheets but, as has been shown above,

of groups; and again among the letters there is some natural group
ing. Γ1111191119 three letters which are printed in the Dc Prac-
paratione, 1534 (L), occur together at the beginning; and of the 18
which appear in the eparcus floridae, 153¹ (J), 17 are found in a
continuone series, which at times follows very closely the order in
which they are printed iu the book. This orderly and yet dieordered
arrangement is just what might be expected in a collection hurriedly
gathered during the necessary dispositione which follow death; and
it is not difficult to suppose that the papers may subsequently have
passed from hand 19 hand without much scrutiny until they reached
the protection of the Oopenhagen Library.

The collection hae considerable velue in the light that it throws
on Erasmus’ practice in the writing and preservation of his corre
spondence. All the letters are rough (lrafts, not a single one having
been actually dispatched, and a few being beck to becken the same
sheet. There is thus proof cf a fact for which there is no other
direct evidence, that Erasmus in his later years usually wrote rough
drafts of his letters, and that these were copied fair by his secretaries
for dispatch. A number of fair copies written by secretaries are of
course in existence ; but except for those under consideration here no
rough drafts are known. This later practice ia in direct contrast tc
that of the period 1516-8, which is represented by the Deventer
better-book (App. 8), when he commonly wrote his letters for dispatoh
and his secretaries copied them for preservation.

The letters bear various marks of revision, besides the corrections
naturally made at the time of first writing. Two of the letters of
¹5²4 have been corrected. One, f. 243, was unquestionably revised
by Erasmus, but asin one place there are tw0 divergences from the.
opus Epistolamm, ¹5²9 (H), the edition in which it was first printed,
it seems doubtful whether the corrections were made with a view to
its publication there. More probably they were made a few years
earlier, and subsequently improved at the time of printing. 'l'he
other letter of 1524, 1 239, presente difficulties There are six cor·
rectione by a contemporary hand, which might be Erasmue’, but
might equally well be that cf his secretary. Here again the cor·
rectione cannot have been made with a view to H, for of the numerous
changes made there none that are really important are found in
these six. So that here too we may attribute them to a revision
at an earlier time.

Three letters of 1528 show revision, cf a different kind in each
case. Inone, f. 198, Erasmusis clearly the author of the changes,
